I run because I love it,\" he says, his modest home lined with trophies that he was once advised to sell for scrap metal.

This remarkable journey reveals what happens when someone sees athletes where others see only poverty, awakening a potential that the athletes were unaware of themselves.",

Decades of research show an inextricable link between evictions and worse health outcomes, says founding executive director Dr. Andrew Boozary. People with mental or physical disabilities, and older adults, are more likely to be evicted, and eviction can increase the likelihood of depression, substance use disorders, suicide, and premature death. UHN&rsquo;s social medicine team is partnering with The Neighbourhood Group Community Services, in which people with lived experience of homelessness or drug use accompany and advocate for patients in the emergency department; as well as LOFT Community Services, which offers expertise in helping people access housing and stay housed. &ldquo;This is preventative medicine,&rdquo; says Dr. Boozary. &ldquo;This is social medicine at its core.&rdquo; The fund kicked off with $1 million raised from donors.",
