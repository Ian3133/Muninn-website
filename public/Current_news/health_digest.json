      "summary": "A comprehensive study involving over 270,000 participants has revealed a potential connection between elevated levels of the amino acid tyrosine and a reduced lifespan in men. Tyrosine, commonly found in protein-rich foods and marketed as a cognitive supplement, may have implications for health and longevity. This finding raises questions about the effects of dietary supplements on lifespan and overall well-being.",

Researchers found that Chlamydia pneumoniae can invade the retina and brain, where it sparks inflammation, nerve cell death, and the buildup of amyloid-beta—the hallmark protein linked to Alzheimer’s. Higher levels of the bacterium were found in people with Alzheimer’s, especially those carrying the high-risk APOE4 gene, and were tied to more severe cognitive decline.",
