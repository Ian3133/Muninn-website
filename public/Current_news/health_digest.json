      "title": "Study Links Higher Tyrosine Levels to Shorter Lifespan in Men",
      "summary": "A comprehensive study involving over 270,000 participants has found that elevated levels of the amino acid tyrosine may be associated with a reduced lifespan in men. Tyrosine, commonly found in protein-rich foods and marketed as a cognitive-enhancing supplement, raises concerns about its long-term health effects. This research highlights the need for further investigation into dietary supplements and their implications for longevity.",

          "description": "A newly discovered bacterial duo may be the hidden cause of chronic constipation. The two microbes break down the colon’s protective mucus layer, leaving stool dry and hard — a problem traditional laxatives don’t fix. Parkinson’s patients, who often struggle with constipation years before tremors appear, have higher levels of these bacteria. Blocking the bacteria’s mucus-destroying enzyme prevented constipation in mice, hinting at a new treatment strategy.",

Researchers at MIT are exploring transcranial focused ultrasound, a noninvasive technology that can precisely stimulate deep regions of the brain that were previously off-limits. In a new “roadmap” paper, they explain how this method could finally let scientists test cause-and-effect in consciousness research, not just observe correlations.",
