      "title": "Study Links Higher Tyrosine Levels to Shorter Lifespan in Men",
      "summary": "A comprehensive study involving over 270,000 participants has found that elevated levels of the amino acid tyrosine may be associated with a reduced lifespan in men. Tyrosine, commonly found in protein-rich foods and marketed as a cognitive-enhancing supplement, raises concerns about its long-term health implications. This research highlights the need for further investigation into the effects of dietary supplements on longevity.",
