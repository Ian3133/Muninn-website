      "summary": "A comprehensive study involving over 270,000 participants has found a correlation between elevated levels of the amino acid tyrosine and a reduced lifespan in men. Tyrosine, commonly found in protein-rich foods and marketed as a cognitive enhancement supplement, may have implications for men's health. This research raises questions about the long-term effects of tyrosine consumption on longevity.",

Researchers discovered that immune cells shed this outer layer to help them exit the bloodstream and enter inflamed skin. This challenges the long-held idea that only blood vessel walls changed during this process. The finding could help guide new therapies aimed at controlling harmful inflammation.",
